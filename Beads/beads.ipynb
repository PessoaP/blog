    "# Sampling probability arrays: a  Python class\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in data science, we often need arrays of weights that sum to one, we call these probability arrays or probability vectors. \n",
    "For example, in classification tasks, we want the output to be a array of probabilities representing predicted class distributions. When implement mixture models, probability arrays can represent the weight of each component. In finance, they might define the weights of assets in a portfolio where the total allocation must sum to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ensuring that these vectors are correctly sampled and always sum to one is not trivial. A simple approach, like sampling random numbers and normalizing them, can lead to uneven or biased distributions. So, how can we guarantee that sampled arrays always meet this constraint?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do so is to imagine placing beads into bins. Picture having a finite number of beads, and distributing them across five bins. Each bin represents one component of the probability array, and the fraction of beads in each bin determines the corresponding probability weight. \n"

    "This analogy is not only intuitive but also robust, as it naturally ensures that the total sum is preserved without needing normalization after. Additionally, this representation provides flexibility: by increasing the number of beads, we can achieve higher precision in our probability arrays. Moreover, this bead-and-bin model offers a precise way to represent probabilities. Since beads are discrete, the total count is inherently stable, avoiding the floating-point errors that can arise when dealing with continuous random variables.\n",

We'll cover three core functions: (i) initializing arrays from raw counts or by another probability vector, (ii) proposing symmetric updates by redistributing beads; and (iii) calculating the log-probability under a multinomial prior, including necessary mathematical corrections. \n",
